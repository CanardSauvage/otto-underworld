OttoUnderworld - An ASCII-RPG

Architecture
------------

* The game uses event-driven communication

Graphics
========

* the game uses a classic tile based approach
* uses [ANSI escape codes][ansi] to format your console output
* as the console is a classic, we also use 80x25
* works on windows, linux and mac
* replacing the console/ansi renderer with a graphics renderer would be easy

Sound
=====

* Nothing included yet ;)
